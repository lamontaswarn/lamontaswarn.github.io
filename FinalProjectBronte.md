## Textual History
Within my research specifically of Charlotte Brontë's poetry, I found that there is a large percent of her and her sisters writings that either remained unfinished or were almost lost in circulation. According to Susan R. Bauman, “In 1846, the Brontë Poems were poised to slip into oblivion. Elizabeth Gaskell comments on the poignancy of their unnoticed entrance into the literary arena when, in The Life of Charlotte Bronte] she depicts the ”little volume of poems" as, "stealing into life", while "some weeks passed over, without the mighty murmuring public discovering that three more voices were uttering their speech" (Gaskell 223).” In her writing titled “In the Market for Fame: The Victorian Publication History of the Brontë Poems”. It was Charlotte's intent to continue on the legacy of her remaining sisters Emily and Anne. This jointly published book did not sell well at all, they again continued to write and thus we have the three poems mentioned in this project. This continued on until people finally caught on to the Brontë sisters writing and then they each became their own writers. 
There is much to be said about the way in which some novels and poetry pieces were published but for the most part they all wrote and published almost together. 
The one thing that caught my eye the most about much of the poems written by Charlotte Brontë is that most of them are shortened in some publications or are under different titles, if they even have one at all. For instance, there is a poem that usually goes by the name of “Obscure and little seen my way”. While reading this poem in the context of various books and renditions of this poem, there is only about fourteen lines that are ever found. Upon my research though I found out that there was a significantly larger amount of content than is usually found. Where the usual rendition of the poem stops at the line that says, “I long have marked and well I know”, there are still thirty lines more of the poem.

## Socio-Historical Context
Since all of Brontë's poems were written in a timeline spanning twenty years, we can only imagine what she specifically was going through in her life, but we do know most of what was happening, especially around her in the world. Haworth was a place where people around town knew everyone. People in Haworth were also described as “self-sufficient”. People of Haworth were normally passive and kept to themselves, which is what probably helped Charlotte to concentrate on her writing for as long as she did. 

## Authorial Biography
Charlotte Brontë was born on April 21st of 1816 to parents Rev. Patrick Brontë and Maria Branwell. While Maria was of higher birth, being from Penzance, and of considerable means, Rev. Brontë was from County Down Ireland. Rev Brontë was an Anglican priest who preached at a curacy in Essex and then later to Yorkshire. The greatest claim to fame and Maria's biggest accomplishment was being the mother to four of the worlds most dazzling and captivating female authors of the world. Charlotte was described as a very small and quiet woman with not any particularly stunning features. Even from a young age, Brontë was motherly to her siblings because of their motherless state when she entered her teens. She was the third of six children being five girls and one boy. On September 15th 1821, Charlotte's mother Maria passed away due to what can only be described as cancer at this time and soon after, all the Brontë sisters were sent to a Clergy Daughters' school in Lancashire. During this time, Charlotte's sisters Maria and Elizabeth died because of poor living conditions in the Clergy school and Charlotte and Emily Brontë were brought back home to their father. Moving forward to the sisters time as Charlotte being Emily and Anne’s governess in 1835, then governess to another family some years after, there was time and opportunity for her to educate her sisters and see to their care. Although in the beginning of this endeavor she nor her sisters had the most open minds, Gaskell stating that, “Mean while Charlotte had resolved that Anne should never return as a pupil, nor she herself as a governess” (Gaskell 149). After such a time, the Brontë sisters began to publish their works under male aliases according to the first letters of their names. For example, Currer Bell, Charlotte, attempted to publish their first novel but was rejected and then a second was accepted in 1847 titled Jane Eyre. Eventually they began to publish under their real names and continued on with their careers. Reading this side of the story from the point of view of Gaskell was eye opening to say the least. Gaskell gives accounts straight from Charlotte herself when she is explaining her reasoning for choosing a pseudonym. She stated that there was some consideration even into how the Brontë’s wrote because they did not want people to suspect their true identities. Brontë states, “We had a vague impression that authoresses are liable
to be looked on with prejudice; we noticed how critics some times use for their chastisement the weapon of personality, and for their reward a flattery, which is not true praise.” (Brontë, Gaskell 271). The sisters wanted their work to speak for itself without attention on their gender and birth. 
In the end Jane Eyre was a complete success and many people suspected the true identity of Currer Bell. Again, Brontë eventually came clean and continued her time writing. As time went on the other two remaining Brontë sister died, Anne at the age of 27 on May 28th of 1849 and Emily at age 29 died on December 19th of 1848. Charlotte died on March 31st of 1855 at 39 years old. Even long after the death of such a prolific writer, there were still poems and pieces of hers and her sisters writings being published posthumously. 


## Editorial Choices
Some of the editorial choices that Brontë makes are extremely fascinating. She emphasizes emotion in very interesting ways and always seems to give something new to a feeling throughout her poetry and writing. When reading Charlottes work, I feel transported into a world completely different from the one I was in. For example, a poem by various titles, but most popularly known as, 'Obscure and little seen my way', Brontë gives us sadness, and love at the same time. There is something so captivating about her lyricism and wit in her writing. She uses description to the best ability possible and it never fails her. There is possibility in her writing while also being able to show us another side of somberness when it is necessary. For example, in her poem, 'Is this my tomb, this humble stone', she ends the first line of the poem not with a question mark, but with a cliff hanger that continues to the next line. Instead she emphasizes the question after the line, “Above this narrow mound?”. This emphasis of line usage says to me as the reader that there was more to the idea of her original question. More needed to be said which keeps the reader hanging on while reading. Choices such as this are beautiful and say so much about the type of care and methodology was being put into her poems. She wanted there to be more than what we thought. She isn't just questioning herself, Brontë is making us question ourselves. 
Another point of interest within the editing style of Charlotte Brontë is the way she uses paragraph style poetry. She runs on the same idea for a few full sentences until it breaks to a fully different paragraph. For example, in the poem “Is This My Tomb? This Humble Stone” She creates suspense by giving us line breaks in paragraph form for the reader to digest in chunks. It is quite pleasing to the eye and it is not something people necessarily keep an eye out for when reading poetry for pleasure. She gives almost bite sized pieces as she continues on through her poetry. 

## Ethical Considerations
The ethical considerations that I have for any of these poems is firstly, almost half of Brontë's work was published posthumously due to rejection, resubmission, or at the very least, not being finished. We need to take that into consideration because there may be a chance that some of them were not revised before she died, so the message set forth may not be the message she intended. Emma, one of Brontë's most important and well-known works was not finished but it was published posthumously in 1860. Later on, it would be continuations of this particular work seeming as though only about twenty pages had been written by Charlotte herself before her death. Because of realities such as this, it is hard to maintain the idea that her works were untouched or published in the fashion she had intended. Unfortunately, we will never know. Another thing we should take into account is the type of person Charlotte was and what most people believe she would have wanted for her legacy.
Charlotte was a very slight and short woman, with a motherly, nurturing disposition to others. She made very meaningful connections with people and enjoyed nothing in particular besides writing and reading. One of her many friends being Elizabeth Gaskell. Gaskell would later write a book titled The Life of Charlotte Brontë where much of the information in this project comes from. While much of what she wrote about Brontë is correct, there is a point where there is not much said at all in her novel. In her novel she fails to report to the reader a very important relationship that Charlotte had acquired between herself and a Mr. Constantin Héger who was, during the course of their friendship, a married man. To the extent of the intimacy in their friendship we do not know, but the fact that Brontë was herself in love with this married man. Information such as this would in my opinion definitely shape in a different way our perception of some of Brontë's writing around the time of her friendship with Mr. Héger and if he had influenced her in any way in her poetry specifically. This is all speculation of course because the public only found out about this friendship after it was published in a Times magazine in London in 1913.
Another ethical point we must hit is the fact that some of the intimate details given to us by Gaskell may be wrong. On one account, there is a point where some of the information about the Brontë women's father Patrick is incorrect, or at least challenged. Gaskell says in her writing that, “In part, I set it down to a fancy Mr. Brontë had of not letting them have flesh-meat to eat.

It was from no wish for saving, for there was plenty and even waste in the house, with young servants and no mistress to see after them; but he thought that children should be brought up simply and hardily: so they had nothing but potatoes for their dinner; but they never seemed to wish for anything else; they were good little creatures. Emily was the prettiest." (Gaskell, 41). This quote being found to be untrue due to a diary entry that had been recovered of Charlottes. While we see that this could be of no fault but oversight, it is seen that there is at least speculation to the validity of Elizabeth Gaskell's portrayal of Charlotte Brontë's life.

# Poems

# 'Obscure and little seen my way'
Obscure and little seen my way 
Through life has ever been,
But winding from my earliest day
Through many a wonderous scene.
None ever asked what feelings  moved
My heart, or flushed my cheek,
And if I hoped, or feared or loved
No voice was heard to speak.

I watched, I thought, I studied long,
The crowds I moved unmarked among, 
I nought to them and they to me
But shapes of strange variety.
The Great with all the elusive shine
Of power and wealth and lofty line
I long have marked and well I know. [^fn1];

# 'Is this my tomb, this humble stone'
Is this my tomb, this humble stone
Above this narrow mound?
Is this my resting place, so lone,
So green, so quite round? 
Not even a stately tree to shade 
The sunbeam from my bed,
Not even a flower in tribute laid 
As sacred to the dead.
I looked along those evening hills,
As mute as earth may be,
I hear not even the voice of rills-
Not even a cloud I see. 
How long is it since human tread
Was heard on that dim track
Which, through the shadowy valleys led, 
Winds far, and farther back?
And was I not a lady once,
My home a princely hall? 
Methinks, as in a doubtful dream, [fn2]
That dwelling proud I see
Where I caught first the early beam
Of being day's spring face.
Methinks the flash is round me still 
Of mirrors broad and bright; 
Methinks I see the torches fill
My chambers with their light, 
And o'er my limbs the draperies flow
All gloss and silken shine,
On my cold brow the jewels glow 
As bright as festal wine. 
Who then disrobed that worshipped form?
Who wound this winding sheet?
Who turned the blood that ran so warm 
To Winter's frozen sleet?
O can it be that many a sun 
Has set, as that sets now,
Since last its fervid lustre shone
Upon my living brow?
Have all the wild dark clouds of night 
Each eve for years drawn on
While I interred so far from light 
Have slumbered thus alone?
Has this green mound been wet with rain-
Such rain as storms distil
When the wind's high and warning strain
Swells loud on sunless hill?

And I have slept where roughest hind
Had shuddered to pass by,
And no dread did my spirit find
In all that snow-racked sky,
Though shook the iron-rails around
As, swept by deepened breeze, 
They gave a strange and hollow sound
That living veins might freeze.[fn3]
O was that music like my own? -
Such as I used to play
When soft and clear and holy shone
The summer moon's first ray, 
And saw me lingering still to feel
The influence of that sky?
O words may not the peace reveal 
That filled its concave high,

As rose and bower how far beneath
Hung down o'ercharged with dew,
And sighed their sweet and fragrant breath
To every gale that blew
The hour for music, but in vain,
Each ancient stanza rose
To lips that could not with their strain
Break Earth's and Heaven's repose. 

Yet first a note and then a line 
The fettered tongue would say,
And then the whole rich song divine
Found free and gushing way.
Past, lost, forgotten, I am here, 
They dug my chamber deep,
I know no hope, I feel no fear,
I sleep - how calm I sleep!

# 'The Orphan Child'
My feet they are sore, and my limbs they are weary;
Long is the way, and the mountains are wild;
Soon will the twilight close moonless and dreary
Over the path of the poor orphan child.

Why did they send me so far and so lonely,
Up where the moors spread and grey rocks are piled?
Men are hard-hearted, and kind angels only 
Watch o'er the steps of a poor orphan child.

Yet distant and soft the night-breeze is blowing,
Clouds there are none, and clear stars beam mild;
God, in His mercy, protection is showing,
Comfort and hope to the poor orphan child.

Even should I fall o'er the broken bridge passing,
Or stray in the marshes, by false lights beguiled, 
Still will my Father, with promise and blessing,
Take to His bossom the poor orphan child.

There is a thought that for strength should avail me,
Though both of shelter and kindred despoiled:
Heaven is a home, and in a rest will not fail me;
God is a friend to the poor orphan child.

## Footnotes 

[^1]: This is not where the full poem ends. This is just the edition that is usually published. 

[^2]: Her language is also something that she purposfully tried to make sound masculine so that she could publish in peace without judgement from people for being a female writer. 

[^3]: Charlotte Brontë's language was always descriptive and world changing. She wanted to transport you to a different world.
